# Webcount
Simple Web app implementing a double counter for a Dialogic experiment. 

Requirements are:
- must keep count of interactions in a group (2 types)
- must identify group and date for experiment
- must be usable by several groups at the same time
- must run on student's iPads (no treatment on client side)
- must stores results on Google Drive.
- nice to have: undo functionality (i.e. clicked on button by mistake)
- no budget =)
